    <p>In 2011 I completed my BA in Social Work at Seattle University. I've largely worked in public service since graduation. Working as a Social Worker and  eventually getting my LICSW is what I thought I wanted to do professionally. <!---It is however something I'm still paying for :(--> However, I've found that this particular intersection of passion and profession weren't woking for me. That realization led me to reconsider what I wanted from my work environment, what I liked best about my work as a Social Worker, and what I could replicate in another field. In doing so I found Web Developement and am excited to start learning more about this field.</p> 
    
    <p> Its my hope that when I look back on my experiences I will not find myself to have had been a barrior. My willingness to dive into something I may not have pracical experience in is something I'm becoming known for. In the last year I've taken up watercolor painting and find it incredibly enjoyable. I have been challenging myself to take on increasingly difficult home impovement projects over the last few years which has resulted in my trying my hand at all sorts of new tools and repairs. </p>
